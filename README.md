3.And the average salary for positions with no remote work option is the lowest at $80,823.
4.The vast majority of data science jobs are full-time positions, with a count of 588.
This indicates a strong preference for full-time employment in the data science field.
5.Large companies show the most significant spread in salaries, with some outliers reaching very high values. 
6.Small and Medium companies have a narrower range of salaries.
